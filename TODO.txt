Plans for the <https://github.com/creideiki/free-penguin> fork:

Documentation

Move pattern pieces onto separate A4 sheets, to avoid having to tape
papers together

Evaluate LibreOffice as a drawing tool, consider porting to Inkscape

Evaluate the wedge construction, consider changing to standard darts

Include seam allowance in pattern pieces

Investigate licensing. How does the pattern being GPL affect finished
plushies? Check how the 3D printing community does things.
